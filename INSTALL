Run 'cabal install' in the parent directory.
Compile the example with 'ghc -O2 -threaded Test --make'.
To run with threads, execute './Test +RTS -N -RTS'
For textual runtime statistics, supply the '-s' flag between the RTS markers. The flags between +RTS and -RTS are not visible to the executable.

For use with Threadscope:
Compile the example with 'ghc -O2 -threaded -eventlog --make Test'.
Run with ./Test +RTS -N -ls -RTS
This will output the file Test.eventlog which can be opened with threadscope.
