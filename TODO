STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS (major changes or improvements increment 2nd digit in version number)
Implement strategy accurate version                                                          -J
Saccharine selection strategy.                                                               -

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS (major changes or improvements increment 2nd digit in version number)
Eliminate fractions (aka keeping the coefficients down).                                     -
Reify finite field types.                                                                    -
Look at e/f4/moninfo.hpp in the M2 code.                                                     -
Memoize finite field tables.                                                                 -
Make the polynomial reduction algorithm smarter.                                             -

PARALLEL EXECUTION IMPROVEMENTS (major changes or improvements increment 3rd digit in version number)
Adaptive parallel selection strategy.                                                        -
Try implementing ideals using [: :]                                                          -J

MISCELLANEOUS IMPROVEMENTS
Write a nice parser.                                                                         -J (?)

Finish the project.                                                                          -F && J

COMPLETED SPECS
