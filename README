This is Yet Another Implementation of Buchberger's Algorithm. It intends to use the standard Control.Parallel libraries to parallelize the algorithm efficiently in Haskell. At the time of this writing, the parallelism employed is coarse-grained - at the level of s-pair reduction. Future implementations may parallelize the algorithm at finer depths (i.e. polynomial and monomial manipulations).
